# Style Guide for American Craft Council

### To get started
1. Checkout the repository `git clone git@github.com:fourkitchens/acc-styleguide.git`
2. Change into (from terminal) the directory of the repository `cd acc-styleguide`
3. Run `npm i && bower i` to pull in node and bower resources.
 - Use node 4.2.1 for node-sass compilation reasons
 - Use nvm to manage node versions
4. Make sure Gulp in installed globally `npm i -g gulp`
5. Run 'gulp'
6. I set up my `localhost` as `acc-styleguide.local.dev` using Vagrant / playbooks, but this can be anything that suits your system.

Theme away!
